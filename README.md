## About Me
I’m a cybersecurity graduate building my skills in **Azure Cloud Security**.  
I hold **CompTIA Security+** and **DFIRA** certifications and enjoy learning how to protect cloud environments by applying security best practices.  
I’m also exploring basic penetration testing to better understand how attackers think, but my main focus is on cloud security.

Currently, I’m studying for **Microsoft Azure certifications**, starting with **AZ-900** as a foundation.
