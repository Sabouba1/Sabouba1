## About Me
Iâ€™m a cybersecurity graduate building my skills in **Azure Cloud Security**.  
I hold **CompTIA Security+** and **DFIRA** certifications and enjoy learning how to protect cloud environments by applying security best practices.  
Iâ€™m also exploring basic penetration testing to better understand how attackers think, but my main focus is on cloud security.

Currently, Iâ€™m studying for **Microsoft Azure certifications**, starting with **AZ-900** as a foundation.
